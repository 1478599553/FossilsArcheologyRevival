Coelacanth, the "Hollow Spine," is
a rare fish that continues to roam
the waters for hundreds of millions
of years since the Devonian Period.
With a length of two meters
and a height of zero point eight
meters, this long creature matches
the size of other fishes from
coelacanth's previous time periods.
Upon discovery in 1938, its place
as a living fossil cemented itself,
but its existence is threatened by
commercial deep-sea trawling despite
the lack of commercial value for the
coelacanth apart from museums and
private collectors. Since the
Devonian Period, it changed its form
little in the over four hundred
million years of survival, and many
believed it to be extinct before
rediscovery. Only two species of
coelacanth remain alive, and due to
this, their threatened status make
the coelacanth the most
endangered order of animals on Earth.
Living along African coasts and in
Indonesian waters, their food and
temperature needs restrict them to
these areas, and they feed in
underwater caves and crevices, which
most rest in during the day time.
It saves vital energy for feeding time
in the night. Many governments around
the world spend money to ensure the
conservation of the coelacanth
population, which no more than a few
hundred is estimated; without this
important effort, the animal that
braved more than four hundred million
years may join the past with extinction.
