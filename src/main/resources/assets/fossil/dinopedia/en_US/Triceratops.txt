Triceratops, the "Three Horned
"Face," is a dinosaur of pointed
interest with large media and
scientific coverage over multiple
fossil specimens. With a tank-like
maximum length of nine meters and
a stout, powerful maximum height of
three meters, triceratops was a
force of nature few reckoned with
Sharing an environment with the
fearsome foes like the T. rex in the
Maastrichtian stage of the 
Cretaceous,triceratops cemented its
prominence among Ceratopsidae.
Likely in order to contest courtship
of females against other males, its
mighty horns and frill grew with
maturity, and recent theories
noted the function of blood
vessels in frills to attract
mates. Like the T. rex,
triceratops wandered about
North America in warm climates,
living in relative harmony with
other herbivores. It browsed
low hanging vegetation with its
beak, and in the event of a
confrontation, triceratops used
its horns to gore opponents into
submission. Inside its beak,
teeth lined the mouth in rows,
which sheared fibrous plants
like palms and cycads in a
vertical orientation. With
a sturdy body and powerful
defenses, the triceratops
asserted itself as a fantastic
creature with a cult-like
following rivaling that of the
Tyrannosaurus rex.
