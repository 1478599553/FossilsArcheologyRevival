Allosaurus, the "Different Lizard,"
provides a "different" example of
an apex predator than that of
the tyrannosaurus. Contrasting with
the T. rex, the allosaurus measured
not much taller than a person
three meters, but it was quite
lengthy at eight and a half meters. 
Abundantly found in the Morrison
Formation, it absolutely dominated
the food chain by preying upon large
herbivores and possibly some
predators. It prowled the lands of
present day America and Portugal 
across semiarid environments
alongside other predators like
Ceratosaurus. Living during the
Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian era
of the Jurassic, allosaurus had a
delectable selection of prey, such
stegosaurs and sauropods. It
actively huntedstegosaurus and other
members of that family for food and
likely scavenged sauropod carcasses,
for it probably only hunted live,
fully grown sauropods in packs.
Its notable skull ridges had
several functions, such as acting
as sun-shades and display items.
Curiously, many fossils found
exhibited odd imperfections,
providing valuable research into
the paleopathology of dinosaurs
and possible effects of it on
the creatures. Living at the
top of the food chain, the
menacing claws and jaws of
the allosaurus was quite the
predator long before the time
of the tyrannosaurus.
