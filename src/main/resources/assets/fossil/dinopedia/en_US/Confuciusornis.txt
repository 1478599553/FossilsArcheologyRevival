Confuciusornis, the "Confucius
Bird," is a well-documented
genus of animals from the Yixian and
Jiufotang Formations in China.
With a height of .2 meters and a
length of .5 meters, the
confuciusornis was not much
different from modern birds.
Despite close relatives of modern
birds possessing teeth, the
confuciusornis had none, and it
was one of the earliest of birds
known to have toothless beaks.
The wing feathers appeared modern
but had different structure compared
to modern birds. Its fossils
preserved many melanosomes, which
contain color; due to this, the
likely colors of the confuciusornis
was grey, red/brown, and black, which
is similar to the zebra finch. The
wings were possibly white with the
long tail feathers being dark along
the entire length. The confuciusornis
suffered from limiations during flight,
such as limited wing amplitude and
insufficient feather strength, and
these findings challenged the
previously conventional belief that
confuciusornis was a competent flier.
The confuciusornis was piscivorous,
feeding upon small fish, but the bird
was common prey for small and medium
sized carnivores. Like the
compsognathus, fossil specimens
preserved fish bones inside the bird.
The confuciusornis is definitely an
intriguing bird with well-preserved
fossils that give us an informed view
of its world during the Cretaceous.
