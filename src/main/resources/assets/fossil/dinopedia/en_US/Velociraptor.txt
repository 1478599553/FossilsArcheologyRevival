Velociraptor, the "Speedy Thief,"
is an insanely popular dinosaur,
but unlike common thought, a truely
speedy, almost unimposingly small
velociraptor similar to a bird
existed, and like a bird, feathers
caked the body of the velociraptor.
Functionally, its feathers
likely possessed a bit of a
vibrant pattern to attract
potential mates. It assisted
in covering nests for brooding
and increased the speed of the
animal. Discovered in modern day
Mongolia, the velociraptor lived
in the current continent of Asia
in arid environments consisting
of mainly sand dunes. Whilst
running about the desert, the
velociraptor scoured for 
vulnerable prey, such as its
infamous adversary, protoceratops.
Fellow velociraptors possibly
collaborated in hunting larger
prey in packs, using their
large toe claw in some aggressive
fashion to secure the kill.
It lived during the late
Cretaceous Period about
seventy-five to seventy-one
million years ago, so it enjoyed
existence before the Cretaceous
Paleogene Extinction Event ended
dinosaur hegemony from the face
of the Earth. As one of the most
intelligent of dinosaurs, it
terrorized the Mongolian landscape,
and the velociraptor's feathers
changed the impression of dinosaurs
held by scientists and some fans.
