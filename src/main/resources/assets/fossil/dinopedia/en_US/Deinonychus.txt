Deinonychus, the "Terrible Claw,"
is a famous dinosaur that
revolutionized dinosaur knowledge
thanks to palentologist John Ostrom.
With a maximum length of three
meters and a maximum height of
about a meter, deinonychus was a
decently strong creature with
a powerful body ready to attack.
Like its fellow dromaeosaurids, it
likely had feathers that covered its
entire body. Living during the
early Cretaceous Period, it made its
home in North America in tropical
climates. The deinonychus hunted
small and medium sized dinosaurs
and attacked them with its toe
claw as it held prey down while it
ate them alive. In addition to this,
deinonychus possibly hunted in packs
to attack larger prey like
tenontosaurus, and the largest of
the group would eat first until the
others were allowed. Otherwise, it
likely attacked any that attempted
to eat while it feasted. Deinonychus'
limbs could grasp and clutch objects
well. Other functions of the limbs
may have included tree climbing,
leading to possible arboreal
behavior with the dinosaur.
The deinonychus' fame still
continues to this day thanks
to John Ostrom, whose studies
during the 1960s changed the
way paleontologists thought about
dinosaurs, and he helped move them
away from this idea of slow, cold
blooded lizards to swift, warm
blooded birds.
