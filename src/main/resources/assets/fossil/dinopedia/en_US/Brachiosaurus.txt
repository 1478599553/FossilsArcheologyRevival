Brachiosaurus, the "Arm Lizard," is
a marvel of the prehistoric world
for the amazing sizes and heights
the mysterious dinosaurs reached
during their long reign over Earth.
With a maximum length of twenty-six
meters and a maximum heigh of seven
meters, the brachiosaurus loomed
over other dinosaurs of the time.
Being a rare sauropod of North
America's Morrison Formation,
brachiosaurus enjoyed existence
among the other sauropods along
other famous creatures like the
stegosaurus as well. Like most
sauropods, its size acted as a
safeguard against the appetites of
predators like allosaurus, and only
the youngest, oldest, and sickest
of sauropods were susceptible to
attack. Due to its heigh, they
took advantage of it to browse
high foliage and sometimes
branched out to the lower plants,
and the brachiosaurus' teeth
sheared the plant matter with
an up-and-down jaw motion.
Living during the Jurassic, it
roamed across North America and
Africa in semiarid environments
with much vegetation to sustain
brachiosaurus. Unlike many other
sauropods, the brachiosaurus
possessed an upward-facing neck
and an enclined back. For a time,
science claimed brachiosaurus as
the largest of the dinosaurs, but
argentinosaurus took the title
away from the popularly beloved
brachiosaurus.
