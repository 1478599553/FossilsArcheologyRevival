Ankylosaurus, the "Fused Lizard,"
is a dinosaur that armor everywhere
could take some notes from. With a
length of about six meters and a
height of over one meter, the
ankylosaurus put every part of its
body to work in protecting himself,
especially with its tail club.
Living during the late Cretaceous
Period alongside dinosaurs like
the T. rex and triceratops, the
ankylosaurus lived in North
America with fierce predators
and competition, but being
the largest known ankylosaurid,
it protected itself with its
tough armor and powerful
tail club. It's wide mouth
allowed the ankylosaurus to
feed on low vegetation of its
choosing. For defense, its
armor consisted of massive
knobs and boney plates
embedded in skin, and it
employed its strong tail
and club against other
dinosaurs if threatened.
The osteoderms were light
and sturdy, and they were
heighly resistant to 
penetrative objects like
the teeth of predators.
It could oscillate its
tail in a hundred degree
motion and use the
powerful club in addition
to its inertia to cause
massive damage to opponents.
The ankylosaurus is so
powerful that it is a tank.
