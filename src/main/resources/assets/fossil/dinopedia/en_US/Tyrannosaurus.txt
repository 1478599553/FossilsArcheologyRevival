Tyrannosaurus rex, the "Tyrant Lizard King," is the most famous dinosaur in existence, being represented in art, literature, entertainment, etc. With a maximum length
at a whopping thirteen meters and a height of over four meters, this creature towered over humans by comparison and many other dinosaurs as well. The last known member
of the tyrannosaurids before the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous Period, the tyrannosaurus easily layed claim to fame within its family of Tyrannosauridae.
Living in the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period, T. rex was among the last of the great non-avian dinosaurs to roam the Earth. The tyrannosaurus lived across
what is now the continent of North America in mainly warm and humid areas, and it lived alongside a plethora of herbivorious animals, including ceratopsians such as
triceratops, hadrosaurs such as the parasaurolophus, armored dinosaurs, and small theropods. When young, tyrannosaurus grew dramatically beyond teenage years, eventually
resulting in the giant creature known and loved by many, but their growth slowed after sixteen as the T. rex physically matures. Following a pattern found in many other
tyrannosaurs, tyrannosaurus died shortly after reaching maturity, and their infants faced high mortality rates in the volatile world of the Cretaceous. Being a carnivore,
the T. rex preyed upon the many herbivores it lived alongside, and art and media commonly depicted it hunting triceratops and edmontosaurus, common prey for the
tyrannosaurus. During dire times, it sometimes cannibalized other members of its species in order to survive. Its hollow bones and swift movements allowed it to actively
hunt its prey.
