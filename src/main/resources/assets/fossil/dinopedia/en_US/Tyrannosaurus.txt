Tyrannosaurus rex, the "Tyrant 
Lizard King," is the most famous 
dinosaur in existence, being 
represented in art, literature,
entertainment, etc. With a 
maximum length at a whopping 
thirteen meters and a height of
over four meters, this creature
towered over humans by comparison
and many other dinosaurs as well.
The last known member of the 
tyrannosaurids before the
extinction of the dinosaurs in the 
Cretaceous Period, the tyrannosaurus 
easily layed claim to fame within
its family, Tyrannosauridae. Living
in the Maastrichtian age of the
upper Cretaceous Period, T. rex was
among the last of the great
non-avian dinosaurs to roam the
Earth. The tyrannosaurus lived
across what is now North America in
warm and humid climates, and it lived
alongside a plethora of herbivorous
animals and small theropods. When
young, tyrannosaurus grew
dramatically beyond teenage years,
eventually resulting in the giant
creature known and loved by many,
but their growth slowed as the T. 
rex matured. Following a pattern in
other tyrannosaurs, tyrannosaurus 
died shortly after reaching
maturity, and their infants died 
normally in the volatile world of 
the Cretaceous. As a carnivore,
it preyed upon herbivores like 
triceratops and edmontosaurus. 
Its hollow bones and swift
movement allowed it to hunt prey.
