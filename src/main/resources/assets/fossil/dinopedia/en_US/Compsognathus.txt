Compsognathus, the "Elegant Jaw,"
may be an adorably small creature,
but it is truely an opportunistic
carivore with a bad attitude.
With a length of a meter and the
height of half a meter, some
members of the species grew to
the size of turkies, but they
likely grew not much more.
Roaming Europe during the Late
Jurassic, the compsognathus lived
in a tropical environment and
preyed on small vertebrates.
Many of its fossils preserved the
contents of its belly well, and
it ate creatures such as lizards.
The compy's small frame and long
tail and limbs likely allowed for
swift movement to outrun and
outmaneuver other small creatures
like birds. Due to the tropical
environment of Europe during the
Late Jurassic Period, the compy
inhabited the archipelago that is
now the large continent, and it
lived isolated from other dinosaurs
due to fossil finds yielding no
other dinosaur remains. Current
fossil finds of the compy are
nearly complete and very well
preserved, and due to the well
preserved nature of the remains,
the contents of the compsognathus'
belly, as mentioned before, give
paleontologists a clear idea of
its diet with certainty, which
is not very common amongst
dinosaurs due to the precarious
nature of the fossil record and
preservation of many fossils.
