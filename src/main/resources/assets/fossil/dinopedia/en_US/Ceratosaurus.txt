Ceratosaurus, the "Horned Lizard,"
is among the well-known theropods
from the Jurassic Period like the
allosaurus. With a length of about
six meters and a height of four
meters, the ceratosaurus was not
a creature of size, but it
compensated for it with ferocity
and power. Unlike other theropods,
ceratosaurus possessed an
abnormally large skull in
proportion to its body with large
nasal and brow crests and a nose
horn; in addition to that,
osteoderms peppered its back,
acting as dermal armor. Roaming
the lands of North America and
present day Portugal during
the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian
eras of the Late Jurassic Period,
the ceratosaurus hunted small
herbivores like Dryosaurus and
fed around waterways rather than
strict hunting of large prey like
the larger carnivores of the day.
The nasal horn in addition to the
crests on the head likely
functioned as mechanisms to
attract mates, and the
ceratosaurus probably dueled with
competing males over a female.
Curiously, many ceratosaurus
fossils found depict a far
range of the different growth
stages of ceratosaurus; thus,
it cements itself as one of the
few dinosaurs with a more complete
record of the various life stages.
Though, like all dinosaurs, there
is still much to know about it.
