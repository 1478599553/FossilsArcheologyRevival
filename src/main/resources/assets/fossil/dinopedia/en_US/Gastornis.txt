Gastornis, the "Gaston's Bird," is
the unwanted stepchild of the
"terror birds;" though related to
fearsome predators, this two-meter-
tall bird is only a terror to 
plants. Conventional wisdom believed
gastornis to be a carnivore, but
the structure of the beak suggests
it fed on tough plant matter. Like 
other terror birds, gastornis'
skull and beak were huge compared
to the rest of its body; however,
unlike the carnivorous terror birds,
gastornis' beak lacked a raptorial 
hook. The deep lower jaw and strong 
muscles gave gastornis quite a nasty
herbivore bite, which was used
to crack open nuts and seeds.
Footprints found exhibit a
distinct lack of hooked talons
that are so popular with its
cooler, carnivorous Terror Bird
friends.

Living during the Paleocene to the
Eocene Periods, gastornis' range
was far and wide across Europe,
the United States, and China. Its
earliest fossils hail from England,
so it likely originated in the
European island continent. Based
on fossil finds, gastornis was the
largest tetrapod on land, but size 
does not exactly scare plants. 
Gastornis probably spread to North
America from the population in
China through the Bering land
bridge
