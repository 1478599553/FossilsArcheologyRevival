Therizinosaurus, the "Scythe
lizard," was, surprisingly enough, a
herbivore despite its intimidating 
exterior. With a maximum length of 
ten meters and a maximum height of 
four or five meters, this freakishly 
tall monstrosity possessed a 
terrifying defining feature: 
incredibly long claws that reached 
the length of a meter. These claws 
likely provided ample protection from the ferocious
predators that dared to prey
upon therizinosaurus. As the last
and largest of the therizinosaurs,
this odd animal roamed the lands
only a few million years before
the large dinosaurs disappeared
from the Earth, and for that, it
serves as the posterchild for its
family, Therizinosauridae. 

Roaming what is modern Mongolia,
therizinosaurus was among odd
herbivores and many carnivores
in scrublands near desert, but
sometimes dense rainforests
provided a wealth of food
to a variety of plantlife,
which housed the rich trees
that therizinosaurus loved to
feast upon the greenery from.
As mentioned before, therizinosaurus,
like other therizinosaurs, was likely
herbivorous and likely used those
large claws of its to reap branches
of leaves and eat them.
